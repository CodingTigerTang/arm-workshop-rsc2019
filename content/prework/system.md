In this workshop, we will use R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). RStudio is not required but recommended, because it makes it easier for an average user to work with R Markdown. If you do not have RStudio IDE installed, you will have to install Pandoc (http://pandoc.org), otherwise there is no need to install Pandoc separately because RStudio has bundled it. 

## Install R and RStudio

* The [latest version of R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (3.5.1 "Feather Spray") is recommended.

## Install RStudio

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (>= 1.1.463).

## Install Git (Optional)

Install Git. https://git-scm.com/downloads You can use RStudio as the Git GUI, so no need to install a separate GUI unless you have your own favorite GUI. For more detailed instructions, see the installation section of [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) for how to install Git on various operating systems.
