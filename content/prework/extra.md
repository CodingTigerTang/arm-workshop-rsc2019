Youâ€™ll get the most from it if you enjoy learning how R Markdown works under the hood (which will involve reading some source code), and are seriously interested in hacking (playing) with:

* [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/html.html), 
* [JavaScript](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/javascript.html), 
* [CSS](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/css.html), 
* [LaTeX](https://yihui.name/tinytex/), and 
* [command-line tools](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/command-line-basics.html). 

We will give minimal tutorials on these languages and tools in the workshop, but it may be easier for you to keep pace with the instructor if you already know them before.
