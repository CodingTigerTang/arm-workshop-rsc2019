## Install Git (Optional)

Install Git. https://git-scm.com/downloads You can use RStudio as the Git GUI, so no need to install a separate GUI unless you have your own favorite GUI. For more detailed instructions, see the installation section of [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) for how to install Git on various operating systems.

To get the most out of this workshop, we will provide tools and tips for using the tools covered in workflows that include RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`), Git (via GitHub using RStudio) for version control, and Netlify for deploying HTML files. 

If you want to take advantage of this advice, we highly recommend that you do the following ahead of the workshop:

  - Work through Happy Git with R to set up a GitHub account 
    - [Register a GitHub account](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    
  - Set up Netlify account (recommended: sign up via your GitHub account) [can provide slide deck for these steps, or embed]
