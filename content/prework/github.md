To get the most out of this workshop, we will typically work within RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`) and encourage you to use Git (via GitHub using RStudio) for version control. You can use RStudio as the Git GUI, so no need to install a separate GUI unless you have your own favorite GUI. If you would like to use GitHub during the workshop, please follow the steps below from the online book [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/):
