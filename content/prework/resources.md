This is a two-day hands-on workshop primarily based on the book ["R Markdown: The Definitive Guide."](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) However, there are several other additional free and open source resources available for some of the individual packages we will cover.

## bookdown: Authoring Books with R Markdown

The **bookdown** package is built on top of R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax (you can learn the basics in five minutes), as well as the possibility of multiple types of output formats (PDF/HTML/Word/...). It has also added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and imported the GitBook style (https://www.gitbook.com) to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. This book itself is an example of how you can produce a book from a series of R Markdown documents, and both the printed version and the online version can look professional. You can find more examples at https://bookdown.org.
