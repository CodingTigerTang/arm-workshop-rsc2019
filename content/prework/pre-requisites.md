You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of the amazing breadth and depth of R Markdown. If you are unsure if this workshop is right for you, take a look at the following questions and see how comfortable you feel answering "yes" to them:

## Markdown 

- For example, do you know how to make first, second, and third-level headings using Markdown?
- Do you know how to use markdown to create [links](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) or make bulleted/numbered lists?
- Do you know how to use markdown to format text in *italics* or **bold**?


> If you do not, we strongly recommend that you complete a [markdown tutorial online](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) ahead of time (takes about 10 minutes).

## R Markdown

- For example, do you know how to insert code chunks to include R code and output in an R Markdown file?
- Do you know how to knit an R Markdown file to HTML or a PDF?
- Do you know what chunk labels and options are? Have you ever set global chunk options in an R Markdown document?
- Do you know what a YAML header is in an R Markdown document, and why/how to edit the YAML front-matter?

> If you do not, we strongly recommend that you read the ["Basics" chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html) ahead of time.
    
## Helpful but not required

To get the most out of this workshop, we will provide tools and tips for using the tools covered in workflows that include RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`), Git (via GitHub using RStudio) for version control, and Netlify for deploying HTML files. 

If you want to take advantage of this advice, we highly recommend that you do the following ahead of the workshop:

  - Work through Happy Git with R to set up a GitHub account 
    - [Register a GitHub account](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    
  - Set up Netlify account (recommended: sign up via your GitHub account) [can provide slide deck for these steps, or embed]
